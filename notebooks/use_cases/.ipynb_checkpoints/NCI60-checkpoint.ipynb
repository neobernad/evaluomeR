First, we exclude the first column from the dataset `nci60`, where the column `Description` is. We then compute the correlation matrix R for data using the `cor` function. To pinpoint the metrics that exhibit perfect correlation (correlation coefficient of 1 or -1), we make use of the `findCorrelation` function from the `caret` package, setting a cutoff of 1. This function returns the names of the variables that are highly correlated, if any."
